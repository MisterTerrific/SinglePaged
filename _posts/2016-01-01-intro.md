# Gerald Kessie
Welcome!
    
I've graduated with a MSc in Computer Science and am now looking for a role as a developer. Programming has been one of my passions for a while now.
     
I am comfortable using a variety of technologies/languages including Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. But I have also previously used React Native, SQL, Objective C, Ocaml, Clojure and MySQL.    
      
Please see a few of the selected projects that I have worked on below.
